Sup,

Here are some rules you must follow to 
create your own theme/s:

1. Make a new directoy with desired name and it
   has to be named different than others.

2. Sprites must be .png files and dimensions
   must be 40 x 40.

3. Audio files must be .mp3 and
   with NO capital letters.

4. All files eg. sprites and sounds must named 
   same way as other themes. 
   
5. The color file must be .txt file and the color
   order must be exactry same.
   
Essentionally you are just overwriting existing
files with your own stuff.
